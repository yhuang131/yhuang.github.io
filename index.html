            <p class="bio">My name is Yifan Huang, come from Shanghai China.<br>
                As a professional in the logistics sector, I have ventured into the realm of computer software engineering with great enthusiasm. Prior to commencing my formal education at IIT, my knowledge of programming and networking was limited to that of a beginner, and I had not undergone systematic training in programming.<br>
                Nevertheless, the allure of computer languages and their remarkable capabilities has always captivated me, keeping me thoroughly engaged and delighted.<br>
                As my studies progressed, the steady accumulation of knowledge has enhanced both the convenience and enjoyment of my daily work and personal life. My prior exposure to network programming was confined to the ITMD515 course offered at IIT, during which I completed a tutorial-based web project under the guidance of Professor Scott Spyrison and achieved satisfactory results.<br>
                Now, as I embark on the ITMD541 course, I aspire to delve deeper into the realm of network programming, seeking to grasp more vivid and practical illustrations and methodologies that will further enrich my understanding and skills in this fascinating field.</p>
